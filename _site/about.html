<p>Hi, I am <u>Zhihan Yang</u>, an undergraduate student at <u>Carleton College</u> (MN, USA) studying <u>Mathematics and Computer Science</u>. You can call me Zhihan. At this point in my life, I'm interested in pursuing a career in machine-learning research (not yet sure which sub-field though).</p>

<p>I've been learning <u>deep learning and reinforcement learning</u> on my own, as my college does not quite offer them. Fortunately, I was able to get involved in some real <u>research experiences</u> during my first two years of college. You can check my papers from my CV (TODO). Also, if you are a college freshman who is interested in research, feel free to shoot me an email at <u>yangz2 at carleton dot edu</u> to ask for advices on doing so.</p>

<p>I use this site to organize my notes so it is not meant to be a porfolio. Despite this, I put a lot of effort in writing good-quality articles (or notes, or posts, whatever you call them) to reinforce my self-study. To my surprise, I find it pretty cool to build and maintain a personal site like this. If you want to start doing the same, make sure to check out <a href='https://youtu.be/T1itpPvFWHI' target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none">this comprehensive course on Jekyll</a>; it is all you need and I'm not affliated with it in any way.</p>
